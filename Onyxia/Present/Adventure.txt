Living Construct. Your creature type is construct. While you were constructed, you are a living creature. You are immune to diseases and the poisoned condition. You are considered a humanoid for the purpose of magic that would recover your hit points. You do not need to eat or breathe in order to survive by normal means, but you must consume food and/or drink to convert the matter into energy internally and/or recieve energy from outside sources. Instead of sleeping, you enter an inactive "sleeping" state. The time required for you to receive the benefits of a short rest is 4 hours, while a long rest is 8 hours. You do not dream in this state; you are fully aware of your surroundings and notice approaching enemies and other events as normal. This state is also used to recharge your internal energy reserves, negating the need to consume food or drink for the purpose of receiving the benefits of a long rest.
