	Lewis Dictatorship
	Lewis gets contacted from the outside world, which have been rebuilding, and offer to trade. Lewis at first accepts the request and invites some into their city. When they arrive in the city however, their life becomes a living hell. With Lewis declaring that the outsiders are thieves and murderers. Lewis then started a massive media campaign, essientially creating all media in the city. And giving citizens free handouts that bended them more to his will. For example, giving tvs so that they can watch him, or VR sets so that they can absorb his messages more. 

	Lewis brings the industrial zone under his rule and is able to to get the whole zone back up and running, producing massive amounts of smog, and requiring citizens to start wearing masks and always take specialized umbrellas (Damaging rain). Stating that outsiders have chosen to gas us into our deaths, Seeing the massive might of out industry.

 	Lewis uses the industrial zone to produce guns and mind control cybernetics. He creates a small advanced task force that are cybernetically enhanced, and buys out the dockyards from Nilhielm. Using them to declare independance from outsiders and declaring a new name Valsano.
	
	Onyxia life - Posionous outside air and water. Drones are used to deliver everything. VR/AR/Internet becomes stable and massive
	The citizens are starting to get more cybernetics, and use VR/AR more in their day to day life. Content with life, average newyorkian
	Onyxia starts to appear more like a cyberpunk city. With neon lights and a massive storm rolling in. And more pride coming from the bridges and dam.
